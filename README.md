# COVID-19 X-ray Detection Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that detects COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The model is built using Python and leverages popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to achieve accurate results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the detection of COVID-19 infections using chest X-ray images. The model applies convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as either COVID-19 positive or negative, providing a fast and reliable diagnostic tool.

### Features
- Binary classification of chest X-ray images (COVID-19 vs. Non-COVID-19).
- Trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.
- Provides a streamlined prediction process with minimal input.
